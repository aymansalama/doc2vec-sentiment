Trump today: "I'd be at 75% approval rating if not for the fake news."

Nope. Not even close. But you'd probably be above 50% if not for all your narcissistic lying, bullying, whining &amp; name calling. In other words, you'd be above 50% if you weren't you. 
It is Saturday, May 25, 2019. One citizen, I call for the resignation and  or impeachment of Donald J Trump as President of the United States.  Please RT fellow citizens and pass it on.

Buttigieg is already on record opposing Chelsea Manning’s clemency. Biden called Assange a “high-tech terrorist.”

 Donald Trump promotes faked altered video to try to make his opponent sound even more deranged than he does. (Impossible) It is absolutely despicable, or perhaps I should say deplorable, that the POTUS would spread lies &amp; trash. So is Trump too stupid to know it's fake? Sad.

Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government.

Donald Trump is close to creating a dictatorship. If you support him, you are dishonoring the millions of veterans who fought against the spread of fascism. If you are in the military now, you are betraying your brothers and sisters oaths to defend our Constitution.

My favorite quote from all the crazy news yesterday ...

"They have unsuccessfully tried to take down the wrong person."

- President Donald J Trump.
If you have any doubt God sent Donald Trump to save America, well then, watch . The man gave up his Billion $ lifestyle and TAKES NO PAY. Only a man, on a mission by God, would do such a thing. Thanks

He seems unhinged?? It's more like the liberal media &amp; Democrats seem unhinged.  The walls are closing in. We're going to find out exactly who broke the law &amp; spied on a political opponent. They will all be held accountable.
For an innocent man, he sure seems unhinged.
The real question is: why doesn’t Donald Trump want Mueller to testify, if he cleared him of any wrong-doing?
Hint: Mueller didn’t clear him. Barr whitewashed and undermined the report findings at every turn. 
Regardless of any smear campaign they print in the media, no matter what they say on TV… 

I am 100% voting for Donald J Trump in 2020… end of story!

Donald Trump is supposed to be having a big meeting in Japan. Instead he’s busy tweeting stupid bullshit about how the Democrats are too mean to him. He sure doesn’t seem like he thinks he’s winning.
Donald Trump is doing king stuff. He is investigating the investigators, his Justice Department is setting the First Amendment aflame, and we might be prepping for war in Iran. The authoritarian flirtation is over. But everyone calm down, right? My latest. 
“All four men were arrested in December 2016, shortly after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency, and charged with treason along with a researcher for the private computer company Kaspersky Lab.” Guess Putin is still hunting, or Barr wouldn’t be right?! 
  When we impeach Donald J Trump for his attempted coup d'etat, we're going to take everybody inconcluding Lindsey Graham to task for assisting him, because of the blackmail he had on them.
Trump may have true believers who'll die for him, but he has a faux Army to support them.
 FUN FACT: Barack Obama Is a better man on every level than Donald Trump.

Trump’s Public... 
  

PLEASE STAND BY: Multiple additions to the  thread are coming from this story. 
Trump shared an altered video of Nancy Pelosi to spread the false notion that she speaks haltingly and incorrectly. First, really, Donald? And second, no one even needs to doctor a video to conclude that your mental faculties are deficient. They just need to watch you speak live.
Never have transgender people been under greater threat than under Donald Trump and Mike Pence. We need the public to wake up and fight back alongside us before it's too late. Consider this the five-alarm call. They are coming after us.
Tell your reps in congress that thoughts and prayers are not quite enough when it comes to stopping Trump - and take a look at the Nation's respectful dissent from the course that the Speaker has chosen -

It is Saturday, May 25, 2019. One citizen, I call for the resignation and  or impeachment of Donald J Trump as President of the United States.  Please RT fellow citizens and pass it on.     
I have zero sympathy for Nancy Pelosi embarrassing herself as Speaker of the House. Her three decades of public self-service &amp; $100 million fortune embody precisely why Donald Trump was sent to the White House.

Nancy is a washed up, power-hungry fool.

She's earned the ridicule.
Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government.

Donald Trump is doing king stuff. He is investigating the investigators, his Justice Department is setting the First Amendment aflame, and we might be prepping for war in Iran. The authoritarian flirtation is over. But everyone calm down, right? My latest.

Strange:

Democrats only want access to classified documents when they hurt the President

They only want transparency as long as it doesn't expose their lies

Donald Trump is supposed to be having a big meeting in Japan. Instead he’s busy tweeting stupid bullshit about how the Democrats are too mean to him. He sure doesn’t seem like he thinks he’s winning.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. This seems very desperate. 

Death penalty for sure 
Look at the trajectory we are on: Donald Trump suggested certain people who investigated him should be executed, he's consolidating power through his attorney general, and he's sharing doctored footage of his political rivals.

ALL OF THIS HAPPENED TODAY.

Honorable (ahem) Speaker Nancy Pelosi:

President Donald J. Trump is the intervention. 

Sincerely,

The American People.
Donald Trump will go down in history as the first American president to have willingly betrayed his own country in service to a foreign enemy. His acts of treason will be taught in history books for generations to come, and the name “Trump” will become synonymous with treachery.
Funniest thing all week ...

Jeremy Scahill blasts "the failure of major news organizations" to see WikiLeaks as a press freedom issue. "If bigger and more powerful news organizations had spoken up earlier about this ... then maybe we wouldn't be in this position with Donald Trump."

John Dean is right. America is way too passive with Trump. He is supposed to work for us. He only has helped himself. ‘Give this jerk some of his own treatment’: Watergate’s John Dean calls on Americans to trash Donald Trump 
 President Donald Trump is acting and talking like he is in total control of the United States.  There is nothing bipartisan (or truthful) about him. He should not be allowed to remain in office. Too important!  Remember when he collaborated with the Russians to win office?
More Democrats should take their political cues from Tammy Baldwin, who just won a Trump state by 11 points.

Donald Trump to skip Scotland during UK visit

Cloudy? Totally false and obviously so transparently not transparent. So easily fact checked. His tax returns, financials, his grades, WH visitor’s logs(even his true golf scores), all remain hidden. Transparent? Dawg don’t hunt. Just Say’n 
President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Anyone else remember how President Trump offered an Olive Branch to the Clintons, et al, immediately following his 2016 election victory?

They spit on the offer. And here we finally are.

Declassification.

The cruel actions taken by the Trump-Pence administration this week have made it clear what advocates have spent the past two years telling anyone who will listen: this White House wants to see us harmed and erased. Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to see us die. (thread)

Let me be clear: it is a disturbing attack on the First Amendment for the Trump administration to decide who is or is not a reporter for the purposes of a criminal prosecution. Donald Trump must obey the Constitution, which protects the publication of news about our government.

I have zero sympathy for Nancy Pelosi embarrassing herself as Speaker of the House. Her three decades of public self-service &amp; $100 million fortune embody precisely why Donald Trump was sent to the White House.

Nancy is a washed up, power-hungry fool.

She's earned the ridicule.
Perhaps all those nay sayers would prefer a third world country and a dictator to live under.. apparently you've been blinded by the left and don't realize that Donald Trump is and was God's answer to a nation sinking in hatred and depravity!!!!  God Bless President Trump
